            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Right of Withdrawal</h2>
            <p>
              You have the right to withdraw from this contract within 14 days without giving any reason.
            </p>
            <p>
              The withdrawal period is 14 days from the day of the conclusion of the contract.
            </p>
            <p>
              To exercise your right of withdrawal, you must inform me (
              <span className="font-medium">[Your Name / Company, Address, Email]</span>) by means of a clear
              statement (e.g. a letter sent by post or email). You may use the model withdrawal form below, but this is
              not obligatory.
            </p>
            <p>
              To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient that you send your communication concerning your
              exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Consequences of Withdrawal</h2>
            <p>
              If you withdraw from this contract, I shall reimburse you all payments received from you without undue
              delay and at the latest within 14 days from the day on which I receive notification of your withdrawal.
              I will use the same means of payment you used for the original transaction, unless expressly agreed
              otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you requested that the service should begin during the withdrawal period, you shall pay me an amount
              proportionate to the services provided up to the time you informed me of the exercise of the right of
              withdrawal.
            </p>
